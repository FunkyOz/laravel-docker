# Laravel Docker

A [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)-based installer and runtime for the [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) web framework,
with full HTTP/2 and HTTPS support.

2. Run `docker compose build` to build fresh images
3. Run `docker compose up --pull --wait` to start the project, add custom options for custom start
4. Open `https://localhost` on web browser
   and [accept the auto-generated TLS certificate](https://stackoverflow.com/a/15076602/1352334).
5. Run `docker compose down --remove-orphans` to stop Docker containers.

## Features
